Enter the help command to get help.
This is the Windows 64-bit version.
This is free and open-source software.

With this shell, you can:
- Handle your system
- Write/Read on files or streams
- Create and configure web servers and clients
- For the Python developers: You can create your own commands by writing Python files. Then you have to type the command
"link" to set the directory where CNShell has to search your commands.

This shell works with Python. You donÂ´t need to install Python to use this shell, but for the developers, it should be required
(example: create your own commands).

- This is the first (and beta) version.
- You can find us on: www.github.com/CaptainFuture-CN.
- It would be nice of you if you could put a star on this repository.
