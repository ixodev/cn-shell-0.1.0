Enter the help command to get help.
This is the Windows 64-bit version.
This is free and open-source software.

With this shell, you can:
- Handle your system
- Write/Read on files or streams
"link" to set the directory where CNShell has to search your commands.

This shell works with Python. You donÂ´t need to install Python to use this shell, but for the developers, it should be required
(example: create your own commands).

- This is the first (and beta) version.
- You can find us on: www.github.com/ixodev.
- It would be nice of you if you could put a star on this repository.
